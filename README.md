## Overview

NoteX is a desktop notes app where every note is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being written to disk. There is no cloud, no account, no server — your notes exist only on your machine, protected by a master password that is never stored anywhere.

---

## Features

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — notes are encrypted at rest using a key derived from your master password via PBKDF2
- **Master password login** — password is never stored; used only to derive the encryption key at runtime
- **Reminders** — set date/time reminders on any note with in-app notifications
- **Pin notes** — keep important notes at the top
- **Icons & colors** — 32 icons and 8 color themes to organize notes visually
- **Search** — live search across titles and content
- **Export / Import** — backup notes to JSON and restore on any device 👈👈👈 its your Backup (You can store/sync to Google Drive/OneDrive)
- **Duplicate notes** — clone any note instantly
- **Fully offline** — no network requests, no telemetry

## How encryption works

1. On first login you choose a master password
2. The app derives a 256-bit key using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations + random salt)
3. Notes are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and written to `~/.notex_notes.enc`
4. The password is **never stored** — only held in memory during the session
5. On sign out, memory is wiped and the session is destroyed

**If you forget your password, your notes cannot be recovered.** There is no reset, no recovery email, no backdoor. This is intentional.

## Data location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows  | `C:\Users\YourName\.notex_notes.enc` |
| macOS    | `/Users/YourName/.notex_notes.enc` | You will need to build
| Linux    | `/home/yourname/.notex_notes.enc` | You will need to build

Back up this file regularly. It is only readable with your password.
